# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover a trend
* This was an exercise on Canvas
* Through UCB's program

*A few of your kickstarters have very high goals, which skews the dat. High goals are unrealistic for the types of productions these are. A more thorough analysis of how much money a play truly needs is recommended. Analyticals show that productions of plays for less than $4000 were most succesfull.
